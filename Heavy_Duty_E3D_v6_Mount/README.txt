# Summary

Heavy duty E3D-v6 mounting bracket for the Creality CR-10. I designed this because the other ones just aren't solid enough. This one mounts using 3 screws, and clamps around the top of the plate for extra support. It also has a tie-wrap pillar for cable management.

This is also designed so the nozzle is roughly in the same place along the z axis as the stock hotend, so no need to mess around with the z home micro-switch, but you will still need to re-level your bed.

It also has 2 generic mounting points each side, that allows people to make custom parts such as probe mounts, cooling fans etc. There are stl and step files for the mating parts of the generic mounts provided. These mounts allow a vertical adjustment of roughly 4mm, and guide rails to keep them oriented correctly when screwed down. As you can see in the pictures, I have experimented with some awesome looking dual cooling fan mounts, but these were functionally quite terrible, so I have not included them. I have however included a left or right hand EZABL mount, although I do not an EZABL probe so I am just guessing at the size and position.

As a bare minimum, you will also need;

2x M3x30 screws
2x M3 nyloc nuts

You can reuse the existing screws from the stock hotend and fan cover, however as these are quite weak and easy to chew up the allen socket, I would recommend using some different screws, in which case you will also need;

2x M3x6 screws
1x M3x20 screws

If you plan on using the mounts either side, these will each require;

1x M3 nyloc nut
1xM3x12 screw

No supports needed, just print as already oriented in the stl's. As these need to be quite strong I recommend using roughly 70% infill and at least 3 perimeters. 

Thanks for looking, hope it's useful!
