E3D V6 mount with 40mm fan for CR-10 by Anzymanz is licensed under the Creative Commons - Attribution license.

# Summary

This is a combined hot end and fan mount I designed for an E3D V6 hot end on the Creality CR-10.

I also made sure this will work with the 50mm fang bracket: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2197329
I used nylon standoffs to get the part cooler in the correct position with the fang part cooler.

You will need two M3 bolts ~ 8mm in length to secure the bracket, and six of either M3 or M2.5 bolts ~ 15mm in length to secure the fan to the duct, and the duct to the bracket.

You will need to print this with supports, but they are removed relatively easily.

This is a work in progress as there will be improvements I need to make, but I have been using this for two weeks without issues!
