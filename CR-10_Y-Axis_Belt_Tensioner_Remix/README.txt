# Summary

This is more of a complete rebuild, rather than a true remix of the donnyb99 fantastic Y-Axis belt tensioner for the Creality CR-10 3D printer. I really liked the design, but felt that the tolerances were not where I felt they should be. The fit was way too loose and sloppy. I also experienced a failure whereby the head of the tensioning bolt pulled through the plastic wall. So I completely rebuilt it in Tinkercad using donnyb99's model as a template. I also added in extra stiffening/bracing, thickened up the structure quite a bit, made seats for the horizonal idler screw sleeves thus allowing more "bite" on the thread. It has a reversed knob for better grip remixed by <a href ="https://www.thingiverse.com/make:357643">Phillipe</a>. The results are pretty awesome. This thing is very robust with way less slop and jiggle.

As noted by donnyb99, you will need one M5x25 bolt and a match nut (hex head is recommended for the screw).

# Print Settings

Rafts: No
Supports: Yes
Resolution: .2 to .1
Infill: 40% (50% recommended)

Notes: 
Print the plate and idler slider with 100% infill. The Tensioner bracket should have at least 8 solid layers on the bottom with 40-50% infill. Print vertically with the 4 "legs" on the bed with minimal supports. Print at a slower speed to prevent detachment as it gets taller. Also use a nice wide brim of at least 8 loops.
